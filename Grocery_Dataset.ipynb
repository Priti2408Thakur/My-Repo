Since 1892 when our great grandfather, Enrico Scoppa and our great grand-uncle, Antonio Ferrara, opera impresario and showman, opened a cafe called Café A. Ferrara in Little Italy section in New York City we have prided ourselves on creating superb Italian specialties   We take the extra step of baking two, three and sometimes four times a day, in small batches. Because of the frequency with which we bake, Ferrara acquired our great reputation for quality and freshness. Today, Ferrara is still a family owned business operated by the fifth generation. Тhat’s perhaps the most wonderful thing about Ferrara. Since its beginning in 1892, the spirit, recipes and devotion to quality has changed very little   Cannolis are made fresh, frozen and shipped on dry ice   1 1/2-2\" In length\\n24 Mini Plain Filled Cannoli\\n24 Mini Hand Dipped Belgian Chocolate Cannoli\\nPlain Cannoli: After thawing should be eaten within 2 hours for maximize crispness\\nChocolate Cannoli: After thawing should be eaten within 48 hours\\nFrozen: Can be stored up to one year   PRODUCED IN A FACILITY WHERE NUTS, MILK, EGGS, SOY & FLOUR ARE PRESENT   24 Mini Plain Filled Cannoli\\n24 Mini Hand Dipped Belgian Chocolate Cannoli\\nPlain Cannoli: After thawing should be eaten within 2 hours for maximize crispness\\nChocolate Cannoli: After thawing should be eaten within 48 hours\\nFrozen: Can be stored up to a year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
